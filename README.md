# CDC Mortality Statistics

I aim to place the 2020 CDC mortality statistics in context with previous years. Statistics for 2011 - 2018 are all obtained from the official CDC mortality reports:
- 2011: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf
- 2012: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_09.pdf
- 2013: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf
- 2014: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf
- 2015: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_06.pdf
- 2016: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_05.pdf
- 2017: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf
- 2018: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm

For 2019, I took the provisional death counts (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm) and simply divided by the population on 7/1/2019 (328,239,523 per https://www.census.gov/popclock/) which is halfway through 2019. This resulted in an approximate death rate of 


| Year | Total Deaths | Deaths per 100,000 population | Life Expancancy |
|------|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| 2011 | 2,515,458 | 807.3 | 78.7 |
| 2012 | 2,543,279 | 810.2 | 78.8 |
| 2013 | 2,596,993 | 821.5 | 78.8 |
| 2014 | 2,626,418 | 823.7 | 78.8 |
| 2015 | 2,712,630 | 844.0 | 78.8 |
| 2016 | 2,744,248 | 849.3 | 78.6 |
| 2017 | 2,813,503 | 863.8 | 78.6 |
| 2018 | 2,839,205 | 867.8 | 78.7 |
| 2019 | ~2,855,000 | ~870 | ? |
