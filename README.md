# CDC Mortality Statistics

I aim to place the 2020 CDC mortality statistics in context with previous years. Statistics for 2011 - 2018 are all obtained from the official CDC mortality reports:
- 2011: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf
- 2012: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_09.pdf
- 2013: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf
- 2014: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf
- 2015: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_06.pdf
- 2016: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr67/nvsr67_05.pdf
- 2017: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09-508.pdf
- 2018: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm

For 2019, I took the provisional death counts (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm) and simply divided by the population on 7/1/2019 (328,239,523 per https://www.census.gov/popclock/) which is halfway through 2019. This resulted in an approximate death rate of 870 per 100,000 population.

For 2020, the data are harder to come by. We have provisionla data for the first 6 months of 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm). For the rest of the year, I took the estimated number of weekly deaths from the CDC excess deaths panel (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm). Note that these do not appear complete after 12/12/2020, so I used the 12/12/2020 numbers to extrapolate for 12/13/2020 through 12/31/2020.

For the 2020 death rate, I took the estimated 2020 death count with the 7/1/2020 estimated US population of 329,877,505 from https://www.census.gov/popclock/.


| Year | Total Deaths | Deaths per 100,000 population | Life Expancancy | Percent Change in Death Rate |
|------|--------------|------------------------------|-----------------| --- |
| 2011 | 2,515,458 | 807.3 | 78.7 | |
| 2012 | 2,543,279 | 810.2 | 78.8 | +0.4% |
| 2013 | 2,596,993 | 821.5 | 78.8 | +1.4% |
| 2014 | 2,626,418 | 823.7 | 78.8 | +0.3%|
| 2015 | 2,712,630 | 844.0 | 78.8 | +2.5%|
| 2016 | 2,744,248 | 849.3 | 78.6 | +0.6%|
| 2017 | 2,813,503 | 863.8 | 78.6 | +1.7%|
| 2018 | 2,839,205 | 867.8 | 78.7 | +0.5%|
| 2019 | ~2,855,000 | ~870 | ? | +0.3%|
| 2020 | ~3,300,000 | ~1,000 | ? | +15%|

__Note: The 2020 numbers are NOT official CDC estimates. They are based on CDC data (see methods above) but the CDC has not released provisional mortality data for all of 2020.__
